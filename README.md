# Lab 01 - Git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom

In this lab, we'll learn how to use the Git version control system, how to use the GitHub remote repository system, and we'll submit this assignment to invole the auto-grader for these lab assignments by writing and submitting a simple Python program.

## Getting Started

Install pytest, which is a module for Python that allows you to verify that your code is correct before you submit, using the following command:

`sudo -H pip3 install pytest`

## Instructions

In this lab...

## Verifying Correctness

Run the pre-written tests that verify that your lab assignment code passes, using the following command:

`pytest --capture=sys`

## Getting Help

If your code does not work, there is always a lab instructor present during your lab period for assistance.  Them not having to mark lab assignment submissions means that they should have plenty of time to ensure that you are able to get your lab assignment submission working by the end of the lab period.

## How to Submit

First, ensure that your code passes the tests (see the section __Verifying Correctness__ for details).  If you are certain that your code passes all of the tests, then you can submit your work using the following commands:

```
git add --all
git commit -m "Lab 01 completed code"
git push origin main
```
